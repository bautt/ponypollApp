  # Pony Poll

  **Interactive quiz app for Splunk — no extra infrastructure needed**

</div>

Pony Poll turns any Splunk instance into a live interactive quiz. Participants join through the Splunk Web UI, enter a nickname, and answer timed questions with instant scoring and feedback. All answers are stored as native Splunk events — no external database or middleware required.

## Installation

### Step 1 — Download

Go to the [**Releases page**](https://github.com/bautt/ponypollApp/releases/latest) and download **`ponypollapp.tar.gz`**.

### Step 2 — Install in Splunk

1. Log in to Splunk Web as an administrator.
2. Click the **⚙ gear icon** next to "Apps", or go to **Apps → Manage Apps**.
3. Click **Install app from file** (top-right).
4. Select the downloaded tarball and click **Upload**.
5. Restart Splunk if prompted.

> **Splunk Cloud:** Use the self-service app install in the Admin Console, or contact your Splunk admin.

### Step 3 — First run

1. Open **Pony Poll** — you land on the **Poll** tab.
2. Go to the **Editor** tab and create your first question, or click **Library** to import a pre-built quiz.
3. Go to the **Admin** tab, pick a quiz, and click **▶ Activate for Self-paced** (or start a Synchronized session).
4. Share the **Play URL** with participants.

### Two entry points

| URL | Who it's for | What they see |
|---|---|---|
| `/app/ponypollapp/poll` | Host / presenter | Full app — Poll, Editor, Analytics, Settings |
| `/app/ponypollapp/play` | Participants | Quiz only — nickname input, questions, score |

Share `/play` with your audience. Both URLs appear in the Splunk navigation bar.

**Getting back to the admin app when Play is the default view:**

| Method | How |
|---|---|
| **⚙ Admin link** | Hover the bottom-right corner of `/play` |
| **URL bypass** | Navigate to `/app/ponypollapp/poll?admin` — skips the redirect for that session |

### Requirements

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| Splunk Enterprise ≥ 8.x | KV Store must be enabled (requires a valid non-free license) |
| Splunk Cloud ✓ | Tested and working — AppInspect approved |
| Browser | Any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) |

> No Node.js, Python, or build tools are needed to run the app — the pre-built JavaScript bundle is included in the tarball.

## Admin tab — running a quiz

### Self-paced mode

```

```
Admin tab → pick a quiz → Mode: Synchronized → ▶ Start Synchronized Session
  → a session number is auto-assigned (00001, 00002, …)
  → participants scan the QR code or open /play
  → they see the session number, enter a nickname, and appear in the lobby
  → host clicks ▶ Launch Quiz (N joined)
  → questions advance on the host's command — all participants see the same question at the same second
  → host clicks ⏹ Reveal Answers → distribution bars + explanation + interim leaderboard shown to all
  → host clicks ▶ Next Question … repeat until done
  → final podium shown to all participants
  → ▶ Start New Session returns to the control room
```

## Quiz library & GitHub sync

### Bundled quizzes

| Quiz | Questions | Topics |
|---|---|---|
| [Splunk4Champions2 — Full Workshop Quiz](quizzes/splunk4champions2-workshop.json) | 42 | SmartStore, buckets, tstats, search modes, lookups, CIM, Dashboard Studio, SPL optimisation — all 6 question types |
| [Splunk4Champions — Advanced Topics](quizzes/splunk4champions.json) | 22 | tstats, buckets, bloom filters, Dashboard Studio, SmartStore, search performance |

### Adding quizzes to the library

1. Create a JSON file in `quizzes/` following the [JSON schema](#importexport-json-format)
2. Add an entry to `quizzes/manifest.json`
3. Copy the file to `src/package/appserver/static/quizzes/`
4. Run `make build` — webpack copies static files automatically
5. Commit and push — the GitHub sync button serves the new quiz without a new app deployment

## Configuration

All settings are in the **Settings** tab inside the app.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Poll title | `Pony Poll` | Shown on the start screen |
| Answer index | `ponypoll` | Splunk index where answer events are written |
| Default view | `Poll` | Switch to `Play` to make `/play` the default entry point |


> **Active quiz** is set from the **Admin** tab — pick a quiz and click **▶ Activate for Self-paced**.

Settings are stored in the `ponypoll_config` KV Store collection.

---

## Roles & permissions

The app ships two custom roles:

| Role | Inherits from | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ponypoll_admin` | `admin` | Edit questions, quizzes, config; view analytics |
| `ponypoll_user` | `user` | Take the quiz and submit answers only |

All built-in Splunk roles work out of the box — no role assignment required for standard installs.

### Capabilities on `ponypoll_user`

| Capability | Why it is needed |
|---|---|
| `edit_kvstore` | Write nickname into the synchronized session lobby |
| `edit_tcp` | Required by `receivers/simple` to accept events from non-admin users |

---

## Splunk SPL examples

```spl
-- All answers for a session
index=ponypoll session_id="<id>" | table _time nickname question answer correct points

-- Leaderboard (best score per player)
index=ponypoll sourcetype=ponypoll_attempt event=quiz_complete
| stats max(total_score) as best_score by nickname | sort -best_score

-- Correct rate by question
index=ponypoll type!=freetext type!=slider
| stats count as total, sum(eval(correct="true")) as correct_count by question
| eval pct_correct=round(correct_count/total*100, 1) | sort -pct_correct

-- Word cloud — top terms for a question
index=ponypoll type=wordcloud question="Name one thing*"
| eval words=split(answer,",") | mvexpand words
| eval word=trim(words) | where len(word)>0
| stats count by word | sort -count | head 30
```

---

## Building from source

Only needed if you want to modify the frontend.

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| Node.js ≥ 16 + Yarn | For building the frontend |
| `make` | For convenience build targets |

```bash
cd src
yarn install        # install JS dependencies
make build          # webpack production build → dist/
make package        # bundle into ponypollapp.tar.gz
```

Install the resulting tarball via Splunk UI as described above.

### Development workflow

```bash
cd src && yarn dev              # webpack watch mode

# After each change, copy the bundle and bump the cache:
sudo cp dist/appserver/static/poll.bundle.js /opt/splunk/etc/apps/ponypollapp/appserver/static/
# then open /_bump in browser
```
